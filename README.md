# CoffeeAuto
This program has been written to automate filling of coffee machine jar with water in our office.

It implies custom made pcb with low end STM32F030F4P6 in TSSOP20 package. But you still can use STM32F0Discovery board.
You will also need a water pump, 2 HSI sensors and float with magnet inside to build  water level sensor (so called float sensor).
